    <div id="section2" class="container-fluid">  <h3>Mission</h3> 
      <p> Our mission is to decrease the national number of unreported sexual assaults and to start a much-needed conversation about it in our society. Through establishing a safe outlet and resources for sexual assault victims, we hope to abolish the victim-blaming cultural norm and encourage women to voice their stories. Together, we can raise awareness of sexual assault, and start a movement. We hope that you will join us on this journey. </p>

    <div id="section3" class="container-fluid"><h3>Myths Debunked</h3>
    	<p> 
        <ol>
          <li>"Rape is about sex."</li>
    FALSE. Rape is not about sex; rather it is about power and control. Rape is an act of violence and it cannot be justified by sexual desires.
          <li>"Sexual perpetrators are usually strangers, who are mentally ill."</li>
    FALSE. In 8 out of 10 cases of rape, the victim knew the purpose who sexually assaulted them.
          <li>"Not fighting back means the victim 'wanted it'."</li>
    FALSE. During sexual assaults, the victim often experiences a "freeze response," in which he or she physically cannot move or speak. 
        </li>
